## Philly JS - React Router

This is the repository from the 6/8/2023 [Philly JS Club](https://phillyjs.com/) talk I gave on React Router (and Remix).

To run this repository:

```sh
> git clone git@github.com:brophdawg11/philly-js-react-router.git
> cd philly-js-react-router
> npm ci
> npm run dev
```

Then open the app on http://localhost:5173.

There are 3 branches in this repository:

- `main` - Full working application
- `skeleton` - Skeleton app we started with at the meetup - contains all the final code in commented out segments at the bottom of the files
- `live-coded` - The final state of our live coding during the metup. Should be pretty close to `main` but if you saw something specific at the meetup that you don't see in `main`, you can find it here
